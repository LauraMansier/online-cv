    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Currently, I am doing my PhD at the University of Amsterdam, 
      where I will be developing necessary ecological knowledge on 
      the role of landscape complementation in supporting focal 
      populations and ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. 
      I will do this through both ecological modelling and ecological 
      monitoring, to establish biodiversity-friendly farming practices 
      with a focus on the landscape.

      - role: PhD Candidate
        time: 2021 - Present
        company: University of Amsterdam
        details: |
          My work aims to understand how population dynamics respond to landscape change, 
          I do so by modelling approaches. My research line focusses on predator-prey 
          dynamics in conservation biological control and, simultaneously, 
          increasing biodiversity in agricultural landscapes.
          This PhD is a part of the research project FRAMEwork - 
          Farmer clusters for Realising Agrobiodiversity Management across Ecosystems - 
          financed by the EU-programme Horizon 2020.
