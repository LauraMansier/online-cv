    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Currently, I am doing my PhD at the University of Amsterdam, 
      where I will be developing necessary ecological knowledge on 
      the role of landscape complementation in supporting focal 
      populations and ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. 
      I will do this through both ecological modelling and ecological 
      monitoring, to establish biodiversity-friendly farming practices 
      with a focus on the landscape.
